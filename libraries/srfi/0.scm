; Title
;  Feature-based conditional expansion construct

; Abstract
;
;  It is desirable that programs which depend on additions to standard Scheme name
;  those additions. SRFIs provide the specifications of these additions ("features"),
;  and SRFI 0 provides the means to actually check that these features are present
;  in the Scheme system by means of the cond-expand construct.
