; BTW, you can start ol session, execute this file using ',load "101. Creating an OpenGL Window.lisp"' command
; and still have interactive console (repl) while OpenGL window renders itself in background.
; Just type '(glClearColor 1 0 0 1)' and you will see that OpenGL window immediately will
; change the background color. Cool, yeah?
